## Overview

Welcome to the Football League Analysis project! This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, focusing on the world's major football leagues. The project utilizes Python, primarily relying on Pandas and NumPy for data preparation and analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.


## Background

Football is a passion shared globally, and understanding the dynamics of major leagues can provide valuable insights. This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis using Python tools to unravel interesting patterns and trends within the football dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes detailed information about player details such as nation, wage, position and age. 

## Analysis

The analysis involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplotlib along with Seaborn for creating insightful charts and graphs. We delve into key aspects such as correlation between age and salary, team best payer and countries whose export most players.

## Usage

To explore the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-league-analysis.git
   ```

2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```
   python main_analysis.py
   ```

3. Explore the generated visualizations and insights.
